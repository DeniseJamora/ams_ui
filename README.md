# ams_ui
Repository for all AMS screens

Note that this is only for viewing the UI and is not to be treated as the AMS itself

Instructions:
1. Download files
2. Move to htdocs folder
3. Move all html files to the main directory (they were separated for organization)

    Directory should now look like this:<br>
    ams_ui<br>
      -- css<br>
      -- js<br>
      -- img<br>
      -- scss<br>
      -- vendors<br>
      <> file_name.html<br>
      <> file_name.html<br>
      
4. Open XAMPP and start apache
5. View the UIs using localhost/ams_ui/folder_name/file_name.html
