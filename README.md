# ams_ui
Repository for all AMS screens

Note that this is only for viewing the UI and is not to be treated as the AMS itself

Instructions:
1. Download files
2. Move to htdocs folder
3. Move all html files to the main directory (they were separated for organization)

    Directory should now look like this:
    ams_ui
      --> css
      --> js
      --> img
      -->  scss
      --> vendors
      <> file_name.html
      <> file_name.html
      
4. Open XAMPP and start apache
5. View the UIs using localhost/ams_ui/folder_name/file_name.html
